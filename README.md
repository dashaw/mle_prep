#### Questions

##### Array & Hashing
* contains-duplicate (easy): array, hashing
* two-sum (easy): array, addition
* top-k-frequent-elements (medium): bucket sort, bubble sort, array, hashing
* encode-and-decode-strings (medium): array, hashing, pretty easy
* *longest-consecutive-sequence (medium/hard): array, hashing, O(n) time constraint, tricky to start then easy
* *product-of-array-except (medium/hard): array, hashing, O(n) time constraint, tricky then easy

##### Two Pointers
* valid-palindrome (easy): string manipulation, reverse array
* 3sum (medium): next step of two-step ii, hash, left & right pointer

##### Sliding Window
* best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock (easy): iterate, compare mins and maxs
* longest-repeating-character-replacement (medium): window, efficiency

##### Stack
* *generate-parentheses (medium): backtracking, recursion, dfs
* car-fleet (medium): stack, monotonic stack, math
* daily-temperature (medium): monotonic decreasing stack, [GOOD]
* valid-parantheses (easy): stack

##### Trees
* maximum-depth-of-binary-tree (easy): dfs
* lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree (medium): binary search tree property

##### Binary Search
* binary-search (easy): basic binary search implementation
* search-a-2d-matrix (medium): binary search, 2d


##### Backtracking
* subsets (medium): dfs, recursion, 2^n
