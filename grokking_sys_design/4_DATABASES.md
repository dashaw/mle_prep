### NOTES
The above limitations can be addressed using databases.

A database is an organized collection of data that can be managed and accessed easily. Databases are created to make it easier to store, retrieve, modify, and delete data in connection with different data-processing procedures.


Some of the applications where we use database management are the banking systems, online shopping stores, and so on. Different organizations have different sizes of databases according to their needs.

Note: According to a source, the World Data Center for Climate (WDCC) is the largest database in the world. It contains around 220 terabytes of web data and 6 petabytes of additional data.

There are two basic types of databases:

1. SQL (relational databases)
2. NoSQL (non-relational databases)

They differ in terms of their intended use case, the type of information they hold, and the storage method they employ.


#### SQL versus. NoSQL
Relational databases, like phone books that record contact numbers and addresses, are organized and have predetermined schemas. Non-relational databases, like file directories that store anything from a person’s constant information to shopping preferences, are unstructured, scattered, and feature a dynamic schema. We’ll discuss their differences and their types in detail in the next lesson.

#### Advantages
Managing large data: A large amount of data can be easily handled with a database, which wouldn’t be possible using other tools.

* Retrieving accurate data (data consistency): Due to different constraints in databases, we can retrieve accurate data whenever we want.
* Easy updation: It is quite easy to update data in databases using data manipulation language (DML).
* Security: Databases ensure the security of the data. A database only allows authorized users to access data.
* Data integrity: Databases ensure data integrity by using different constraints for data.
* Availability: Databases can be replicated (using data replication) on different servers, which can be concurrently updated. These replicas ensure availability.
* Scalability: Databases are divided (using data partitioning) to manage the load on a single node. This increases scalability.
