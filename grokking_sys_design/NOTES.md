#### Notes

##### Availability
Availability is the percentage of time that some service or infrastructure is accessible to clients and is operated upon under normal conditions. For example, if a service has 100% availability, it means that the said service functions and responds as intended (operates normally) all the time.

Mathematically, availability, A, is a ratio. The higher the A value, the better.
​

##### Reliability
Reliability, R, is the probability that the service will perform its functions for a specified time. R measures how the service performs under varying operating conditions. We often use mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR) as metrics to measure R.

##### Scalability
Scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of workload without compromising performance. A search engine, for example, must accommodate increasing numbers of users, as well as the amount of data it indexes.

##### Maintainability
Besides building a system, one of the main tasks afterward is keeping the system up and running by finding and fixing bugs, adding new functionalities, keeping the system’s platform updated, and ensuring smooth system operations. One of the salient features to define such requirements of an exemplary system design is maintainability. We can further divide the concept of maintainability into three underlying aspects:

1. Operability: This is the ease with which we can ensure the system’s smooth operational running under normal circumstances and achieve normal conditions under a fault.
2. Lucidity: This refers to the simplicity of the code. The simpler the code base, the easier it is to understand and maintain it, and vice versa.
3. Modifiability: This is the capability of the system to integrate modified, new, and unforeseen features without any hassle.
