#### Notes

##### Availability
Availability is the percentage of time that some service or infrastructure is accessible to clients and is operated upon under normal conditions. For example, if a service has 100% availability, it means that the said service functions and responds as intended (operates normally) all the time.

Mathematically, availability, A, is a ratio. The higher the A value, the better. We can also write this up as a formula:

A (in percent) = \frac{(Total\ Time\ - Amount\ Of\ Time\ Service\ Was\ Down)}{Total\ Time} * 100
Total Time
(Total Time −Amount Of Time Service Was Down)
​

##### Reliability
Reliability, R, is the probability that the service will perform its functions for a specified time. R measures how the service performs under varying operating conditions.
We often use mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR) as metrics to measure R.

MTBF = \frac{Total\ Elapsed\ Time - Sum\ of\ Downtime}{Total\ Number\ of\ Failures}
MTBF= 
Total Number of Failures
Total Elapsed Time−Sum of Downtime
​

MTTR = \frac{Total\ Maintenance\ Time}{Total\ Number\ of\ Repairs}
MTTR= 
Total Number of Repairs
Total Maintenance Time


​##### Scalability
Scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of workload without compromising performance. A search engine, for example, must accommodate increasing numbers of users, as well as the amount of data it indexes.
