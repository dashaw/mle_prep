#### Notes

##### Availability
Availability is the percentage of time that some service or infrastructure is accessible to clients and is operated upon under normal conditions. For example, if a service has 100% availability, it means that the said service functions and responds as intended (operates normally) all the time.

Mathematically, availability, A, is a ratio. The higher the A value, the better.

##### Reliability
Reliability, R, is the probability that the service will perform its functions for a specified time. R measures how the service performs under varying operating conditions. We often use mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR) as metrics to measure R.

##### Scalability
Scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of workload without compromising performance. A search engine, for example, must accommodate increasing numbers of users, as well as the amount of data it indexes.
